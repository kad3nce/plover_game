How to play, using the latest version of the code:
==================================================
1. Check out or download/unzip the code.
2. Download and install the dependencies (a python module called "bottle", and another called "jinja2).  
    - Get bottle by running "pip install bottle" or otherwise it should be available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bottle/0.10.9.
    - Jinja2 can be acquired similarly by running "pip install jinja2", or get it from PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jinja2/2.6
3. Add your desired .lrc file to the lrc directory (make note of the filename you use).
4. Add your desired .mp3 file to the static/media/ directory, making sure it has the name filename _prefix_ as the .lrc file (e.g. stillalive.mp3, if you used stillalive.lrc)
5. Run the server process: python server.py
6. Connect to localhost:8080/play/yourfilenameprefix (e.g. localhost:8080/play/stillalive if you added lrc/stillalive.lrc and static/media/stillalive.mp3).

If you own the rights and/or the rights to the files are permissive enough, fork the code, add your .lrc/.mp3 files, and submit a pull request, and I'll add it to the master branch so others can play.
Please don't hesitate to leave feedback, whether for bugs or feature requests.

Thanks, and enjoy!
