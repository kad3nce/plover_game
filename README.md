How to play, using the latest version of the code:
==================================================
1. Check out or download/unzip the code.
2. Download and install the dependencies (a python module called "bottle", and another called "jinja2).  
    - Get bottle by running "pip install bottle" or otherwise it should be available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bottle/0.10.9.
    - Jinja2 can be acquired similarly by running "pip install jinja2", or get it from PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jinja2/2.6
3. Run the server process: python server.py
4. Connect to localhost:8080/

If you own the rights and/or the rights to the files are permissive enough, fork the code, add your .lrc/.mp3 files, and submit a pull request, and I'll add it to the master branch so others can play these songs by default.
Please don't hesitate to leave feedback, whether for bugs or feature requests.

Thanks, and enjoy!
